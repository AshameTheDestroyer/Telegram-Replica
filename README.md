#Telegram-Replica

After my first project was done using React JS, I wanted to dive deeper into it, and also explore what hard things may occur when developing a real website, so I thought it'd be so challenging to recreate Telegram from scratch, which's obviously insane if you're considering it to be done entirely..

So instead I'm actually hoping to recreate only its front-end UI, and entirely everything it has to offer, 'cuz y'know I'm still new in the field.
